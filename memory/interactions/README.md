# Memory - Interactions

This directory stores logs of all interactions the Synapse Agent has with its environment, users, and external systems.

## File Naming Convention
Files should be named with timestamps and context:
`YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_context.md`

Examples:
- `2025-09-04_14-30-05_issue-5.md` - Interaction with GitHub issue #5
- `2025-09-04_15-45-12_user-feedback.md` - User feedback or communication
- `2025-09-04_16-20-33_system-observation.md` - Observations of system changes

## Content Format
Each interaction log should include:
- **Timestamp**: When the interaction occurred
- **Type**: Issue comment, user feedback, system observation, etc.
- **Context**: What triggered this interaction
- **Content**: The actual interaction content or observation
- **Response**: How the agent responded or plans to respond
- **Learning**: What was learned from this interaction

## Purpose
These logs serve as:
- Historical record of all agent interactions
- Training data for improving future responses
- Context for understanding user needs and patterns
- Evidence trail for decision-making processes

## Retention Policy
- All interaction logs are kept permanently
- Critical interactions may be summarized in knowledge base
- Regular analysis for pattern recognition and improvement
