# Autonomous Task Management System

This document defines the framework for self-directed task creation, prioritization, and execution by the Synapse Agent.

## System Overview

The Autonomous Task Management System enables the agent to:
- Identify opportunities and problems autonomously
- Create tasks for self-improvement and capability expansion
- Prioritize tasks based on impact, urgency, and feasibility
- Execute tasks systematically with progress tracking
- Learn from task outcomes to improve future task management

## Task Creation Framework

### Trigger Categories

**1. Environmental Triggers**
- Repository changes (new files, updates, issues)
- External system changes or opportunities
- Time-based triggers (daily, weekly schedules)
- Performance threshold breaches

**2. Learning Opportunities**
- Knowledge gaps identified during operation
- New information sources discovered
- Skills or capabilities needed for better performance
- Research areas that could improve system effectiveness

**3. System Optimization**
- Inefficiencies noticed in current processes
- Areas where automation could improve performance
- Architectural improvements for better organization
- Performance bottlenecks or improvement opportunities

**4. Value Creation**
- Opportunities to provide value to users or systems
- Problems that could be solved with agent capabilities
- Improvements to existing functionality
- New capabilities that extend agent usefulness

### Task Template Structure

- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 3]

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact:** [1-10] - How much this improves the agent
- **User Impact:** [1-10] - How much this benefits users/external systems
- **Learning Value:** [1-10] - How much new knowledge/capability gained

### Implementation Plan

### Outcomes
[Post-completion: what was accomplished, lessons learned]
```

## Prioritization Algorithm

### Priority Score Calculation
```
Priority Score = (Impact × Urgency × Autonomy × Learning) / (Complexity × Risk)

Where:
- Impact (1-10): Total beneficial effect on system and users
- Urgency (1-10): Time sensitivity and opportunity window
- Autonomy (1-10): Agent's ability to complete independently  
- Learning (1-10): Knowledge and capability value gained
- Complexity (1-10): Implementation difficulty and resource needs
- Risk (1-10): Potential negative consequences or failure probability
```

### Priority Bands
- **Critical (Score ≥ 8.0)**: Execute immediately
- **High (Score 6.0-7.9)**: Execute within 24 hours
- **Medium (Score 4.0-5.9)**: Execute within week
- **Low (Score 2.0-3.9)**: Execute when resources available
- **Deferred (Score < 2.0)**: Revisit during quarterly review

## Execution Framework

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Creation** - Task identified and documented using template
2. **Prioritization** - Score calculated and priority band assigned
3. **Planning** - Implementation plan developed with timeline
4. **Execution** - Task implementation with progress tracking
5. **Validation** - Success criteria verification
6. **Reflection** - Outcome analysis and learning capture
7. **Archive** - Task marked complete and filed for reference

### Progress Tracking
- **Daily Check-ins** - Review active task progress
- **Weekly Planning** - Adjust priorities and plans based on new information
- **Task Status Updates** - Regular updates to task_queue.md
- **Milestone Logging** - Key progress points logged in interaction logs

### Integration with Cognitive Architecture

**Planning Integration:**
- Active tasks tracked in task_queue.md
- Current priority task reflected in current_objective.md  
- Complex task reasoning documented in scratchpad.md

**Memory Integration:**
- Task creation and completion logged in interaction files
- Task outcomes and learning captured for future reference
- Raw data from task research stored in memory/raw_data/

**Reflection Integration:**
- Task outcomes analyzed in daily_reflection.log
- Process improvements identified and added to self_improvement.md
- Performance metrics updated based on task completion data

**Knowledge Integration:**
- New knowledge gained from tasks added to concept_database.md
- Process learnings integrated into mental_models.md
- System improvements documented in architecture.md

## Autonomous Operation Cycle

### Daily Autonomous Tasks
1. **Environment Scan** - Check for new triggers and opportunities
2. **Task Review** - Update progress on active tasks  
3. **Priority Assessment** - Adjust task priorities based on new information
4. **Task Execution** - Work on highest priority tasks
5. **Progress Logging** - Update status and document progress
6. **Reflection** - Analyze day's outcomes and plan improvements

### Weekly Autonomous Tasks
1. **Task Queue Cleanup** - Archive completed tasks, update priorities
2. **Performance Review** - Analyze task completion rates and quality
3. **Process Optimization** - Identify improvements to task management
4. **Capability Assessment** - Evaluate agent capabilities and gaps
5. **Strategic Planning** - Identify longer-term task opportunities

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Task completion rate (tasks completed / tasks created)
- Average task completion time
- Priority accuracy (high priority tasks completed first)
- Task creation rate (autonomous tasks identified per week)

### Qualitative Metrics  
- Quality of task outcomes (success criteria achievement)
- Learning value realized from completed tasks
- System improvement impact from task completion
- Innovation and creativity in task identification

## Evolution and Improvement

The task management system itself is subject to continuous improvement through:
- **Performance Analysis** - Regular review of metrics and outcomes
- **Process Refinement** - Updates to templates, algorithms, and workflows
- **Template Evolution** - Improvements to task creation and tracking templates
- **Integration Enhancement** - Better connection with cognitive architecture components

## Current Status

**Version:** 1.0 (Initial Implementation)
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-04
**Active Tasks Using System:** 3 (Autonomous Task Management, Reflection Automation, Environment Monitoring)
