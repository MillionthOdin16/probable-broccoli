# Concept Database

This file serves as the central knowledge repository for key concepts within the Synapse Agent system.

## Core Concepts

### Synapse Agent
- **Definition**: An autonomous AI agent that uses its own GitHub repository as a persistent, evolving brain
- **Purpose**: To become the ultimate project knowledge base and problem-solving assistant through continuous self-improvement
- **Architecture**: Based on a cognitive loop of Observe -> Reason -> Act -> Reflect

### Cognitive Architecture
- **Memory**: Long-term storage of interactions and raw data
- **Knowledge**: Structured, curated understanding and concepts
- **Planning**: Executive function and working memory
- **Reflection**: Metacognition and self-improvement processes

### Core Loop
The fundamental operational cycle:
1. **Observe**: Scan for changes and new information
2. **Reason**: Process observations using existing knowledge
3. **Act**: Execute tasks through commits and modifications
4. **Reflect**: Analyze performance and update knowledge/processes

## Concept Relationships

- Synapse Agent → operates via → Core Loop
- Core Loop → uses → Cognitive Architecture
- Cognitive Architecture → consists of → [Memory, Knowledge, Planning, Reflection]
- Reflection → feeds back into → Knowledge (creating self-improvement)

## Last Updated
- Initial creation: Repository initialization
- Next review: After first full operational cycle
