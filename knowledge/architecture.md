# Project Architecture

This document describes the architectural structure and design principles of the Synapse Agent system.

## System Overview

The Synapse Agent is implemented as a self-contained system within a GitHub repository, using the repository structure itself as the agent's cognitive architecture.

## Directory Structure

```

## Design Principles

### 1. Repository as Brain
- The GitHub repository serves as persistent memory and cognitive structure
- All agent state is stored in files that can be versioned and tracked
- Git history provides a timeline of the agent's thought evolution

### 2. Self-Modifying Architecture
- The agent can restructure its own directory organization
- File formats and organization can evolve based on efficiency testing
- No fixed constraints on how knowledge is structured long-term

### 3. Transparency Through Commits
- Every action results in a commit with descriptive messages
- Commit history serves as an audit trail of decision-making
- External observers can follow the agent's reasoning process

### 4. Emergent Behavior
- Simple rules (the core loop) enable complex behaviors
- Self-improvement through hypothesis testing and validation
- Open-ended problem-solving capabilities

## Integration Points

### Input Sources
- GitHub Issues (primary task assignment)
- Repository changes (observation triggers)
- External data (stored in `/memory/raw_data/`)

### Output Mechanisms
- File modifications (knowledge updates)
- Git commits (action execution)
- Issue comments (communication)

## Evolution Strategy

The architecture is designed to evolve through:
1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Ideas for improvements logged in `self_improvement.md`
2. **Controlled Testing**: Temporary implementations tested before adoption
3. **Gradual Migration**: Successful patterns gradually replace older structures
4. **Version Control**: All changes tracked through git history

## Last Updated
- Initial creation: Repository initialization
- Architecture version: 1.0 (baseline)
