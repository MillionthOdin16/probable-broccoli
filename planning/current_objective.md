# Current Objective

## Primary Objective
**Initialize and establish the Synapse Agent cognitive architecture within the GitHub repository.**

## Objective Details
- **Goal**: Create a fully functional autonomous AI agent system that uses the repository as its persistent brain
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Complete directory structure established (`/memory`, `/knowledge`, `/planning`, `/reflection`)
  - All core files created with initial content
  - System ready to begin the Observe → Reason → Act → Reflect cycle
  - Documentation in place for future reference and evolution

## Context
This is the foundational objective - the "genesis" of the Synapse Agent. All future objectives will build upon this cognitive architecture. The agent must establish its basic structure before it can begin autonomous operation.

## Priority Level
**CRITICAL** - This is the prerequisite for all future agent functionality.

## Timeline
- Start: Repository initialization
- Target Completion: Initial commit of complete architecture
- Next Objective: Begin first operational cycle (observation of environment)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Knowledge base files initialized
- [ ] Planning system operational
- [ ] Reflection system ready
- [ ] First commit with complete architecture completed

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational task)

## Notes
This objective represents the transition from "blank slate" to "functional cognitive agent." Upon completion, the agent should be ready to begin autonomous operation and self-improvement cycles.
