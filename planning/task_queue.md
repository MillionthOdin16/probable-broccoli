# Task Queue

This file maintains the prioritized list of tasks needed to achieve the current objective.

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
1. **[COMPLETED]** Create cognitive architecture directory structure
   - Status: All directories created successfully
   - Result: `/memory`, `/knowledge`, `/planning`, `/reflection` established

2. **[COMPLETED]** Initialize knowledge base files
   - ✅ `concept_database.md` - Key concepts defined
   - ✅ `architecture.md` - System structure documented
   - ✅ `mental_models.md` - Reasoning frameworks established

3. **[COMPLETED]** Set up planning system files
   - ✅ `current_objective.md` - Primary goal documented
   - ✅ `task_queue.md` - This file (self-referential)
   - ✅ `scratchpad.md` - Reasoning workspace ready

4. **[COMPLETED]** Initialize reflection system
   - ✅ `daily_reflection.log` - First reflection entry created
   - ✅ `self_improvement.md` - Improvement framework established

### Medium Priority
5. **[COMPLETED]** Create initial memory structure
   - ✅ Set up `/memory/interactions/` with README
   - ✅ Set up `/memory/raw_data/` with README  
   - ✅ Create interaction log for initialization process

6. **[COMPLETED]** Document initialization process
   - ✅ Log created in memory/interactions
   - ✅ Initial state recorded in reflection system

### Low Priority  
7. **[NEXT]** Begin first operational cycle
   - Implement Observe phase (scan for changes)
   - Test Reason phase (process using scratchpad)
   - Execute Act phase (make first autonomous commit)
   - Complete Reflect phase (analyze results)

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Create base directory structure (`/memory`, `/knowledge`, `/planning`, `/reflection`)
- ✅ Initialize knowledge base files with comprehensive content
- ✅ Set up planning system with objective, queue, and scratchpad
- ✅ Initialize reflection system with logging and improvement frameworks  
- ✅ Create memory structure with README documentation
- ✅ Document initialization process in interaction log
- ✅ Complete cognitive architecture initialization

## Task Management Notes
- Tasks are executed in priority order
- Each completed task should be moved to "Completed" section
- New tasks discovered during execution should be added with appropriate priority
- Task status: [NOT STARTED] → [IN PROGRESS] → [PENDING REVIEW] → [COMPLETED]

## Next Task to Execute
**Begin first operational cycle** - Start the autonomous operation with environment observation, reasoning, action, and reflection phases.

## Architecture Initialization: COMPLETE ✅

The Synapse Agent cognitive architecture has been successfully established. All required directories, files, and initial content are in place. The system is now ready for autonomous operation.
