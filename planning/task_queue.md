## Current Task Execution Focus
**Autonomous Task Management System Implementation** - Creating the foundation for self-directed task creation, prioritization, and execution.

## Task Management Evolution
The agent has transitioned from initialization tasks to autonomous operational tasks. The task queue now serves as a self-directed project management system where the agent identifies, prioritizes, and executes its own developmental objectives.

## Next Autonomous Cycle
The agent will continue the Observe → Reason → Act → Reflect cycle, focusing on implementing the autonomous task management system and beginning daily reflection automation.
