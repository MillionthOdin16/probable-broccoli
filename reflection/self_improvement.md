# Self-Improvement Hypotheses

This file maintains a list of theories about how the Synapse Agent can improve its own processes, along with experimental plans to test these hypotheses.

## Active Hypotheses

### H001: File Organization by Frequency
**Hypothesis:** Organizing knowledge files by access frequency rather than topic might improve retrieval speed.

**Rationale:** Frequently accessed information should be easier to locate and update.

**Test Plan:** 
1. Monitor which knowledge files are accessed most often over first week
2. Create alternative organization in `/tmp/knowledge_test/`
3. Time common operations under both systems
4. Measure cognitive overhead of each approach

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Low
**Expected Timeline:** Week 2-3

### H002: Automated Template Generation
**Hypothesis:** Creating templates for common file types will reduce time spent on repetitive formatting and increase consistency.

**Rationale:** Many files follow similar patterns (reflection entries, interaction logs, task definitions).

**Test Plan:**
1. Identify the 3 most common file formats
2. Create templates with placeholder content
3. Test template usage vs. manual creation
4. Measure time savings and consistency improvements

**Status:** Not started  
**Priority:** Medium
**Expected Timeline:** After first full operational cycle

### H003: Cross-Linking Knowledge Enhancement
**Hypothesis:** Adding more cross-references between knowledge files will improve context awareness and decision-making quality.

**Rationale:** Isolated knowledge is less useful than connected knowledge networks.

**Test Plan:**
1. Establish baseline decision quality metrics
2. Add systematic cross-references to all knowledge files
3. Compare decision quality before/after cross-linking
4. Monitor navigation efficiency improvements

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High
**Expected Timeline:** Week 2

## Tested Hypotheses

### None Yet
*This section will contain hypotheses that have been tested, along with results and conclusions.*

## Rejected Hypotheses

### None Yet  
*This section will contain hypotheses that were tested and found to be ineffective or counterproductive.*

## Improvement Process

### Hypothesis Generation
Sources for improvement ideas:
- Inefficiencies noticed during operation
- External feedback on performance
- Comparison with other AI systems
- Theoretical improvements from AI research

### Experimental Design
All hypothesis tests should include:
- Clear success/failure criteria
- Quantitative measurements where possible
- Control conditions for comparison
- Limited scope to minimize risk

### Implementation Guidelines
- Test in isolated environments first
- Document all changes thoroughly
- Have rollback plans for failed experiments
- Get multiple data points before conclusions

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Efficiency**: How to complete tasks faster without sacrificing quality
2. **Knowledge Organization**: Optimal structure for information storage and retrieval
3. **Decision Making**: Improving the quality of autonomous choices
4. **Learning Speed**: How to integrate new information more effectively
